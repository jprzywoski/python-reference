    Returns the sum of two expressions.
`- (subtraction)`_
    Returns the difference of two expressions.
`* (multiplication)`_
    Returns the product of two expressions.
`** (power)`_
    Returns the value of a numeric expression raised to a specified power.
`/ (division)`_
    Returns the quotient of two expressions.
`// (floor division)`_
    Returns the integral part of the quotient.
`% (modulus)`_
    Returns the decimal part (remainder) of the quotient.
    
Assignment Operators
====================
`= (simple assignment)`_
    Assigns a value to a variable(s).
`+= (increment assignment)`_
    Adds a value and the variable and assigns the result to that variable.
`-= (decrement assignment)`_
    Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns the result to that variable.
`*= (multiplication assignment)`_
    Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
`/= (division assignment)`_
    Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
`**= (power assignment)`_
    Raises the variable to a specified power and assigns the result to the variable.
`%= (modulus assignment)`_
    Computes the modulus of the variable and a value and assigns the result to that variable.
`//= (floor division assignment)`_
    Floor divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.

Relational Operators
====================

    Returns a Boolean stating whether one expression is less than the other.
`<= (less than or equal)`_
    Returns a Boolean stating whether one expression is less than or equal the other.

Boolean Operators
=================
`and`_
    Returns the first operand that evaluates to *False* or the last one if all are *True*.
`or`_

==========
`in`_
    Returns a Boolean stating whether the object is in the container.
    
Deletion
====
`del`_
    Removes object.

Callables Operators

`* (tuple packing)`_
    Packs the consecutive function positional arguments into a tuple.
`** (dictionary packing)`_
    Packs the consecutive function keyword arguments into a dictionary.
`* (tuple unpacking)`_
    Unpacks the contents of a tuple into the function call.
`** (dictionary unpacking)`_
    Unpacks the contents of a dictionary into the function call.
`@ (decorator)`_
    Returns a callable wrapped by another callable.
`() (call operator)`_
    Calls a callable object with specified arguments.
`lambda`_
    Returns an anonymous function.

Bitwise Operators
=================
`& (bitwise AND)`_
    Returns the result of bitwise AND of two integers.
`| (bitwise OR)`_
    Returns the result of bitwise OR of two integers.
`^ (bitwise XOR)`_
    Returns the result of bitwise XOR of two integers.
`<< (left shift)`_
    Shifts the bits of the first operand left by the specified number of bits.
`>> (right shift)`_
    Shifts the bits of the first operand right by the specified number of bits.
`~ (bitwise complement)`_
    Sets the 1 bits to 0 and 1 to 0 and then adds 1.
    
Bitwise Assignment Operators
============================
`&= (bitwise AND assignment)`_
    Performs bitwise AND and assigns value to the left operand.
`|= (bitwise OR assignment)`_
    Performs bitwise OR and assigns value to the left operand.
`^= (bitwise XOR assignment)`_
    Performs bitwise XOR and assigns value to the left operand.
`<<= (bitwise right shift assignment)`_ 
    Performs bitwise left shift and assigns value to the left operand.
`>>= (bitwise left shift assignment)`_
    Performs bitwise right shift and assigns value to the left operand.

Misc
====
`; (statement separator)`_
    Separates two statements.
`\ (line continuation)`_
    Breaks the line of code allowing for the next line continuation.
`. (attribute access)`_
    Gives access to an object's attribute.

String and Sequence Operators
